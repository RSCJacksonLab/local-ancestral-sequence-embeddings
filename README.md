# Learned ancestral sequence embeddings

Learned ancestral sequence embeddings (LASE) are protein embeddings derived from training a light-weight language model on ancestral protein sequence data.

This repository contains the script used for training a transformer for LASE. It contains raw script for training the language model, training scikit learn regressors on saved representations and evaluating the ruggedness of landscapes resulting from these representations.
